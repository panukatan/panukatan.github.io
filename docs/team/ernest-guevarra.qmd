I am an independent public health consultant with more than 20 years of professional experience in community and public health in humanitarian crises and developing country-settings, including as a community health worker, medical doctor, and most recently as the Head of Valid Measures, the specialised metrics, analytics and technology unit of [Valid International](https://www.validinternational.org). I have expertise in spatial epidemiology, geo-statistics, cartography and statistical programming. In my role as head of Valid Measures, I led the design, development and implementation of innovative surveys and assessments on health and nutrition and bespoke analytical approaches that leverage the advantages of Bayesian statistics and resampling techniques. I am a founding member of [Katilingban](https://katilingban.io/), a collective of public health and nutrition experts and practitioners. I am currently a [consulting research data scientist](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/personnel/dr-ernest-guevarra) for [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/) to support its computational analytics work in support of pandemic preparedness and One Health research and a Senior Research and Teaching Associate at the [Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/), [Nuffield Department of Medicine](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).
