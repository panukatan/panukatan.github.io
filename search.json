It is practical in deliberating, deciding, and delivering the rehabilitation of Marawi City.\n\nThe {openmarawi} R package supports this effort by providing an application programming interface to the Open Marawi shared Google Drive. Consistent with the principles of Open Marawi, the {openmarawi} R package is built and distributed open source on a platform that allows and encourages community contribution using a programming language that is also open and freely available to use.\nWe believe that through this added layer of interface to the Open Marawi datasets, a cadre of users and developers - including those from Marawi itself - can support the process of mapmaking, placemaking, and decision-making that the Open Marawi effort has initiated and continue to encourage.",

    "text": "Why paglaom?\nThe word paglaom (pronounced as /paɡˈlaʔom/, [pʌɡˈl̪a.ʔɔm]) is Bisaya (one of up to 187 languages spoken in the Philippines in addition to Filipino, which is the national language, and English, which is the language of instruction in the country) for hope. PAGASA, the national meteorological and hydrological services agency of the Philippines, draws its name from the Filipino word pag-asa which means hope. The repository name choice, hence, is a play on these words and also a way to showcase the richness and diversity that exists in the Pilippines.\nThe paglaom project aims to maintain a database of curated datasets on varios atmospheric, geophysical, and astronomical phenomena that are made publicly available by PAGASA on their website. These datasets tend to be summaries of the multitude of data that PAGASA collects on a high frequency basis. They also tend to be in formats that are not machine-readable (e.g., PDF, PNG, HTML formats) meant for reporting to the Philippine population. PAGASA does provide more granular and expansive datasets through a specific data request process. The paglaom project aims to showcase publicly available PAGASA data that can be used for various purposes some of which are:\n\nfor students who need to make a report on topics covered by PAGASA’s summarised data for a school assignment or project;\nfor individuals who have specific interest in one of the natural phenomena that PAGASA monitors and would like to get raw summarised data in a format that is usable and transferrable into other formats;\nfor data visualisation learners and aficionados who want to try on working on data about the various natural phenomena available from PAGASA and create unique and interesting plots and graphics.\n\nThe broader and more blue skies vision of the paglaom project is to contribute to the increasing interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects particularly in the Philippines with a collection that showcases topics and data that are homegrown and embedded into the fabric of Philippine life.\nWhilst the paglaom project by its name and the nature of the data it curates has an inherent Filipino audience, it is hoped that those outside of the Philippines will also find the information within useful in similar contexts described above.",

    "text": "Oceans and seas significantly impact continental weather, with evaporation from the sea surface driving cloud formation and precipitation. Tropical cyclones, warm-core low-pressure systems, form over warm oceans where temperatures exceed 26°C, precipitated by the release of latent heat from condensation. These cyclones, known by various names depending on the region, have organised circulations and develop primarily in tropical and subtropical waters, except in regions with cooler sea surface temperatures and high vertical wind shears. They reach peak intensity over warm tropical waters and weaken upon landfall, often causing extensive damage before dissipating.\nThe Philippines frequently experiences tropical cyclones (called bagyo - pronounced /baɡˈjo/, [bɐɡˈjo] - in the Filipino language) because of its geographical position. These cyclones typically bring heavy rainfall, leading to widespread flooding, as well as strong winds that cause significant damage to human life, crops, and property. Data on cyclones are collected and curated by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).\nThis package contains Philippine tropical cyclones data from 2017 to 2021 in a machine-readable format. It is hoped that this data package provides an interesting and unique dataset for data exploration and visualisation as an adjunct to the traditional iris dataset and to the current palmerpenguins dataset.",
