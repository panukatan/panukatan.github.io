Tropical cyclones, warm-core low-pressure systems, form over warm oceans where temperatures exceed 26°C, precipitated by the release of latent heat from condensation. These cyclones, known by various names depending on the region, have organised circulations and develop primarily in tropical and subtropical waters, except in regions with cooler sea surface temperatures and high vertical wind shears. They reach peak intensity over warm tropical waters and weaken upon landfall, often causing extensive damage before dissipating.\n\nThe Philippines frequently experiences tropical cyclones (called ***bagyo*** - pronounced /baɡˈjo/, [bɐɡˈjo] - in the Filipino language) because of its geographical position. These cyclones typically bring heavy rainfall, leading to widespread flooding, as well as strong winds that cause significant damage to human life, crops, and property.
