From the [Open Marawi website](www.openmarawi.com):

> ## Why Open Marawi?

>The citizens of Marawi have a right to the data and maps about their home city. When problems are complex, helping people find useful maps (access) can aid them both in finding themselves in the map (understanding) and making the map by themselves (ownership).
 
> Open data and useful maps can help empower citizens in mapmaking, placemaking, and decision-making because it can help citizens and interested parties in understanding the issues spatially. It is practical in deliberating, deciding, and delivering the rehabilitation of Marawi City.

The `{openmarawi}` R package supports this effort by providing an application programming interface to the [Open Marawi shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bph1LBRpxwydAvjuggyjmhmq6HhyteY8). Consistent with the principles of Open Marawi, the `{openmarawi}` R package is built and distributed open source on a platform that allows and encourages community contribution using a programming language that is also open and freely available to use.

We believe that through this added layer of interface to the Open Marawi datasets, a cadre of users and developers - including those from Marawi itself - can support the process of mapmaking, placemaking, and decision-making that the Open Marawi effort has initiated and continue to encourage.
